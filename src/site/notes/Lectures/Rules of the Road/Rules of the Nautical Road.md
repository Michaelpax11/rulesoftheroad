## **International - Inland**
***
Retired CAPT Levine
##### Opening Statistics
Collisions more common at night, most common on 4-8 watch. Change in visibility is a contributing factors.

Three ways for vessels to meet (with collision case %): 
- Head on (closing speed is the sum of each vessels' individual speed) - 72% of cases
- Crossing - 9% of cases
- Overtaking - 9% of cases
- Uncertain - 10% of cases

Collision rarely due to lack of knowledge. Mostly due to lack of time and practice. 
##### Quick History
Started in about 1840 codified in England. Generally accepted by most maritime nations in latter half of 19th century. Continual edits even currently.

You do not have to be in danger to sound the danger signal, can be used in any scenario where doubt is present

### Rules 1-3
General Rules
##### [[Lectures/Rules of the Road/Rules of the Road index/Rule 1 - General\|Rule 1 - General]]
These rules apply to all vessels:
- International - on high seas and all connecting waters navigable by seagoing vessels
- Inland - inland waters og the US within lines of demarcation

Special Rules may be enacted by host nation for special purpose vessels but should not c conflict with intl rqmts

SECNAV may authorize special lights, shaped and signals for warships

Huey P long bridge is a **line of demarcation** - Inside of line is inland outside of line is international. 

No international/inland in Alaska and Puget sound. All international

Specific rules for traffic separation schemes (Rule 10)

vessels of special construction shall comply as closely as possible with respect to the rules.

The inland rules also apply to vessels of the United states on the Canadian waters as long as there is no conflict with Canadian law

##### [[Lectures/Rules of the Road/Rules of the Road index/Rule 2 - Responsibility\|Rule 2 - Responsibility]]
Nothing in these rules shall exonerate any vessel, or the owner, master or crew thereof, from the consequences of any neglect to comply with these rules.

Due regard shall be had to all dangers of navigation and collision, may make a departure from these rules to avoid immediate danger. 

Catch all rule, person in charge must do everything possible to avoid collision.

Rule 2(a):
- Obeying the rules of the road
- Taking the best possible actions to avoid collision
- Taking action to lessen the effects of collision
- using radiotelephone properly
Rule 2(b)
- When the rules do not cover a situation, catch all.
- The essential purpose of the rule is to make it possible for vessels to take appropriate action in special circumstances to avoid "Immediate Danger"

More than two vessels approaching each other with a risk of collision

Presence of shallow water, or presence of third vessel that makes it impossible to maneuver
##### [[Lectures/Rules of the Road/Rules of the Road index/Rule 3 - Definitions\|Rule 3 - Definitions]]
General definitions

Vessel - every description of water craft, including non-displacement craft and sea planes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water.

Power Driven Vessel - any vessel propelled by machinery

Sailing vessel - under sail provided that propelling machinery, if fitted, is not being used

Vessel engaged in fishing - vessel fishing with nets, lines, trawls, or other fishing apparatus which restricts maneuverability, but does not include a vessel fishing with trolling lines or other fishing apparatus which does not restrict ability to maneuverability.

Seaplane - includes any aircraft designed to maneuver on the water

Vessel not under command - vessel which through some exceptional means is unable to maneuver as required by these rules and is therefore unable to keep out of the way of another vessel eg. rudder failure

Vessel restricted in ability to maneuver - vessel which from the nature of her work is restricted in her ability to maneuver

Vessel constrained by Draft - water too shallow to adequately maneuver

Underway - vessel not at anchor, or made fast to the shore or aground

Restricted visibility - Condition in which visibility is restricted by fog, mist, falling snow, heavy rainstorms, sandstorms, or any other similar causes

WIG - Wing in Ground, uses cushion of air to travel just above the waters surface

Length and breadth 

Vessels shall be deemed to be in sight of one another only when one can be observed visually from the other
***
## ANY CONDITION OF VISIBILITY
##### [[Lectures/Rules of the Road/Rules of the Road index/Rule 4 - Visibility\|Rule 4 - Visibility]]
There are 3 sections to Part B, the steering and sailing rules:

Section I applies to "_**any condition of visibility**" and includes rules 4-10. these rules must be followed at all times.

Section II includes Rules 11-18 and applies to vessels "_**in sight of one another**"

Section III applies to vessels in "restricted visibility" and is comprised of rule 19

##### [[Lectures/Rules of the Road/Rules of the Road index/Rule 5 - Look Out\|Rule 5 - Look Out]]
Every vessel SHALL AT ALL TIMES maintain a proper lookout by sight and hearing as well as by all means appropriate in teh prevailing circumstances and conditions so as to make a full appraisal of the situation and of the risk of collision

No duties shall be assigned or undertaken which would interfere with the keeping of a proper lookout.

The duties of the lookout and helmsman are separate, and a helmsman who is steering is not a lookout 

during the day, circumstances may permit the watch officer to sagely be the sole lookout, but only after he/she assesses each situation.

Assistance must be immediately available

##### [[Lectures/Rules of the Road/Rules of the Road index/Rule 6 - Safe Speed\|Rule 6 - Safe Speed]] 
"Every vessel shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that she can take proper and effective action to avoid collision and be stopped within a distance appropriate to teh prevailing circumstances and conditions"

Notice that the rule _Does not define_ what safe speed is but rather instructs you to constantly evaluate the prevailing circumstances and conditions 

Factors determining safe speed include: 
- Visibility constions
- traffic density 
- maneuverability of the vessel , especially stopping distance
- background lights at night 
- wind and current
- navigational hazards
- depth of water

Additionally, vessels with operational radar shall consider:
- Characteristics, efficiency and limitations of the radar equipment
- Range scale in use
- Effect against sea state, weather, and other sources of interference
- ability to detect small vessels and objects such as ice (may not be able to detect)
- The number, location, and movement of vessels detected
- Effective use in determining a more exact range of visibility

##### [[Lectures/Rules of the Road/Rules of the Road index/Rule 7 - Risk of collision\|Rule 7 - Risk of collision]]
All available means **shall** be used to determine if risk of collision exists; if in doubt as to whether or not it exists, assume that it does!!

If your vessel has a radar and it is operational, it shall be used for long range scanning and tracking(determine risk of collision early)

Assumptions shall not be made on the basis of scanty information, especially scanty radar information

To determine if risk of collision exists, take into account:
- whether the compass bearing of an approaching vessel does not appreciably change (constant bearing - decreasing range)
- Size of the vessel 
- range of the vessel

##### [[Lectures/Rules of the Road/Rules of the Road index/Rule 8- Action to Avoid Collision\|Rule 8- Action to Avoid Collision]]
Any action taken to avoid collision shall be positive, made in ample time and with due regard to the observance of good seamanship.

Any alteration of course or speed to avoid collision shall be large enough to be readily apparent to another vessel observing visually or by radar

A succession of small alterations of course or speed should be avoided.

Alteration of course alone may be the most effective action to avoid a close-quarters situation provided that it is made in good time, is substantial and does not result in another close-quarters situation.

**Take early and substantial action**

Let the other vessel be certain you ate taking appropriate action

Make sure the other vessel is safely "past and clear" - A suitable distance apart.

If necessary or you need more tine to assess the situation, slow down or stop.

###### Head on situation
Turn to starboard, pass port to port.
###### Crossing situation
vessel to starboard is stand on vessel. 
###### Overtaking situation
Forward vessel is stand-on vessel, pass on either side - Use whistle signals to communicate

##### [[Lectures/Rules of the Road/Rules of the Road index/Rule 9 - Narrow Channels\|Rule 9 - Narrow Channels]]
A "narrow channel" is not defined in teh Rules. there are no limits to length, width or depth, except in relation to the vessels involved.

In general, it may be considered narrow when, due to depth or distances between hazards, one or both vessels are severely restricted in room to maneuver. 

A channel marked by buoys may be considered a "narrow channel" to a deep draft vessel but not to a shallow draft vessel that can navigate outside the buoyed channel.

Stay as near to the starboard side of the channel as possible. 

INLAND - a PDV operating on teh Great lakes, western rivers, or waters specified by the Secretary AND proceeding DOWN BOUND with a following current shall:
- Have right-of-way over an UP BOUND vessel
- propose the manner and place of passage
- initiate the appropriate signals

The up bound vessel shall hold as necessary to permit safe passing.

Vessels of less than 20 meters in length or a sailing vessel shall not impede the passage of a vessel which can safely navigate ONLY within a narrow channel or fairway.

A vessel engaged in fishing shall not impede the passage of any other vessel navigating within a narrow channel or fairway.

SAILFISH 20 - sailing, fishing, <20m shall not impede channel

A vessel shall not cross a narrow channel or fairway if such crossing impedes the passage of a vessel which can safely navigate only within such channel or fairway.
- International - The latter vessel MAY sound the Danger signal
- Inland - The latter vessel SHALL sound the danger vessel

INT - when a vessel being overtaken in a narrow channel or fairway has to take action to permit safe passing, both vessels must exchange the signals of Rule 34

The overtaking vessel can only proceed after the overtaken vessel signals its agreement. if the overtaken vessel does not agree she MAY sound the sound the danger signal.

INLAND - comms may be exchanged via radio. 

The overtaking vessel can only proceed after the overtaken vessel signals its agreement. if the overtaken vessel does not agree she SHALL sound the sound the danger signal.

A vessel nearing a bend or an area of a narrow channel or fairway where other vessels may be obscured SHALL navigate with particular alertness and caution and SHALL sound ONE PROLONGED BLAST(4-6secs)

Any vessel SHALL avoid anchoring in a narrow channel

##### [[Lectures/Rules of the Road/Rules of the Road index/Rule 10 - Traffic Separation Schemes\|Rule 10 - Traffic Separation Schemes]]
A vessel using a traffic separation scheme **SHALL**:

proceed in the appropriate direction for the lane it is in 

keep clear of the separation zone

normally join or leave a traffic lane at teh termination of the lane, but if entering from either side, the vessel shall do so at as small an angle as possible

a vessel shall, so far as practicable, avoid crossing traffic lanes but if obliged to do so shall cross on a heading as nearly as predictable at right angles to the general direction of traffic flow.

a vessel not crossing or joining a scheme shall not normally enter a separation zone except:
- in case of emergency to avoid immediate danger 
- to engage in fishing within a separation zone

A vessel engaged in fishing shall not impede the passage of any vessel following a traffic lane

A vessel of less than 20 meters in length or a sailing vessel shall not impede the safe passage of a power driven vessel following a traffic lane

A vessel restricted in her ability to maneuver is exempted from complying with this rule to the extent necessary to carry out her operation

##### [[Lectures/Rules of the Road/Rules of the Road index/Rule 11 - Overtaking, Meeting, and Crossing\|Rule 11 - Overtaking, Meeting, and Crossing]]
The Rules concerning overtaking, meeting, and crossing situations apply ONLY to vessels in sight of one another

This means that vessels can see each other visually

"in sight" does NOT include the use of radar

##### [[Lectures/Rules of the Road/Rules of the Road index/Rule 12 - Sailing Vessels\|Rule 12 - Sailing Vessels]]
When two sailing vessels are approaching, wind coming over port side is the give way vessel

Boom to starboard - give way
Boom to port - stand on

When both have the wind on teh same side, teh vessel which is to windward on the same side, the vessel which is to windward has to give way

##### [[Lectures/Rules of the Road/Rules of the Road index/Rule 13 - Overtaking\|Rule 13 - Overtaking]]
Any vessel overtaking any other shall keep out of the vessel being overtaken

A vessel is overtaking if 

If in doubt as to whether an overtaking situation exists, assume it does

Any subsequent alteration of bearing shall not make the overtaking vessel a crossing vessel

The overtaking vessel is NOT relieved of her responsibility to remain clear until she is finally past and clear of the vessel being overtaken

Overtaking vessel is the give-way vessel

##### [[Lectures/Rules of the Road/Rules of the Road index/Rule 14 - Head on Situation\|Rule 14 - Head on Situation]]
Occurs when two POWER DRIVEN vessels are meeting on reciprocal or nearly reciprocal courses and risk of collision exists

Each vessel shall alter course to starboard and pass PORT to PORT

A head on situation exists when each vessel sees the other vessel ahead on a seemingly reciprocal course and by night she can see the masthead lights of the other in a line or nearly in a line 

***Differences with the inland rule***
Unless otherwise agreed, which allows vessels in inland waters to pass Starboard to Starboard

A PDV operating on the Great Lakes, Western Rivers or waters specified by the Secretary AND proceeding DOWN BOUND with a following current SHALL:
- Have right of way over an UP BOUND vessel
- propose the manner and place of passage
- initiate the appropriate signals 

Communicating via cell phone is not considered good seamanship

##### [[Lectures/Rules of the Road/Rules of the Road index/Rule 15 - Crossing Situation\|Rule 15 - Crossing Situation]]
Occurs when two PDVs are crossing paths so as to involve risk of collision

the vessel that has the other on her own starboard side shall keep out of the way and SHALL, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid crossing ahead of the other vessel

Additional section for inland rule:
On the great lakes, western rivers or water specified by the secretary --- 

Masthead lights so power driven

##### [[Lectures/Rules of the Road/Rules of the Road index/Rule 16 - Action by the give way vessel\|Rule 16 - Action by the give way vessel]]
Take early and substantial action

Let the other vessel be certain you are taking appropriate action

Make sure the other vessel is safely "past and clear" - a suitable distance apart

Action must fall within the guidelines of Rule 8
- any condition of visibility 

##### [[Lectures/Rules of the Road/Rules of the Road index/Rule 17 - Action by Stand on Vessel\|Rule 17 - Action by Stand on Vessel]]
Applies when 1 of 2 vessels is to keep out of the way - Risk of collision must exist. the stand on vessel must:

Hold course and speed

let the other vessel take appropriate action

If the give way vessel fails to act, the stand on vessel MAY take appropriate action

Stand on vessel does not have to take appropriate action until she finds herself so close that collision cannot be avoided by the action of the give way vessel alone
This point is known as "In extremis"

only at the time of in extremis, is the stand on vessel REQUIRED to take action

##### [[Lectures/Rules of the Road/Rules of the Road index/Rule 18 - Responsibilities Between Vessels\|Rule 18 - Responsibilities Between Vessels]]
Who has to keep out of the way?

This rule applies except where the following Rules otherwise require:

- Rule 10 - Traffic separation Schemes
- Rule 13 - Overtaking

From MOST to LEAST privileged:
Vessel Not under command
Vessel Restricted in ability to maneuver
Vessel Constrained by draft

##### [[Lectures/Rules of the Road/Rules of the Road index/Rule 19 - Conduct of vessels in restricted visibility - Missing info\|Rule 19 - Conduct of vessels in restricted visibility - Missing info]]
Applies to vessels not in sight of one another when navigating in or near an area of restricted visibility

if you can see the other vessel, this Rule does not apply

every vessel shall proceed at a safe speed (PDV engines ready for maneuver)

Necessity to keep a proper and vigilant lookout

Restricted visibility - Rules 4-10 in section I apply at all times. this rule applies i addition to those rules

Risk of collision - if detected by radar alone:
- Take avoiding action in ample time
- There is no right of way, no stand on vessel, no give way vessel, and no time for playing waiting games
this rule takes the negative approach and tells you what you should avoid doing.

Risk of collision - if detected 

To overtake another vessel in restricted visibility is extremely hazardous and should be avoided.

When navigating in or neat an area of restricted visibility vessels are required to sound fog signals

unless you determine there is no risk of collision, anytime you hear a fog signal apparently coming from forward of your beam you should;
- slow to bare steerageway and take all way off your vessel
- Navigate with extreme caution
