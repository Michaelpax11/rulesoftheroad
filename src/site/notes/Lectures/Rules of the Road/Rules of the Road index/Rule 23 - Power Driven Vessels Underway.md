**Two** masthead lights if **greater than 50m** - Front will always be lower

**One** if **below 50m**, can add more but not required

Vessels **less than 20m**:
- The single masthead light need not be placed forward of amidships BUT shall be as far forward as practical
Vessels less than 12m
- May substitute an all around masthead light

WIG - high intensity flashing red light
