Any action taken to avoid collision shall be positive, made in ample time and with due regard to the observance of good seamanship.

Any alteration of course or speed to avoid collision shall be large enough to be readily apparent to another vessel observing visually or by radar

A succession of small alterations of course or speed should be avoided.

Alteration of course alone may be the most effective action to avoid a close-quarters situation provided that it is made in good time, is substantial and does not result in another close-quarters situation.

**Take early and substantial action**

Let the other vessel be certain you ate taking appropriate action

Make sure the other vessel is safely "past and clear" - A suitable distance apart.

If necessary or you need more tine to assess the situation, slow down or stop.
