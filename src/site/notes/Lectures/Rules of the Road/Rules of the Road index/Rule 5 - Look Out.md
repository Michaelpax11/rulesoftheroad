Every vessel SHALL AT ALL TIMES maintain a proper lookout by sight and hearing as well as by all means appropriate in teh prevailing circumstances and conditions so as to make a full appraisal of the situation and of the risk of collision

No duties shall be assigned or undertaken which would interfere with the keeping of a proper lookout.

The duties of the lookout and helmsman are separate, and a helmsman who is steering is not a lookout 

during the day, circumstances may permit the watch officer to sagely be the sole lookout, but only after he/she assesses each situation.

Assistance must be immediately available
