# Rule 19

Applies to vessels not in sight of one another when navigating in or near an area of restricted visibility

if you can see the other vessel, this Rule does not apply

every vessel shall proceed at a safe speed (PDV engines ready for maneuver)

Necessity to keep a proper and vigilant lookout

Restricted visibility - Rules 4-10 in section I apply at all times. this rule applies i addition to those rules

Risk of collision - if detected by radar alone:
- Take avoiding action in ample time
- There is no right of way, no stand on vessel, no give way vessel, and no time for playing waiting games
this rule takes the negative approach and tells you what you should avoid doing.

Risk of collision - if detected 

To overtake another vessel in restricted visibility is extremely hazardous and should be avoided.

When navigating in or neat an area of restricted visibility vessels are required to sound fog signals

unless you determine there is no risk of collision, anytime you hear a fog signal apparently coming from forward of your beam you should;
- slow to bare steerageway and take all way off your vessel
- Navigate with extreme caution
