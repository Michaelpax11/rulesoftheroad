# Rule 6

"Every vessel shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that she can take proper and effective action to avoid collision and be stopped within a distance appropriate to teh prevailing circumstances and conditions"

Notice that the rule _Does not define_ what safe speed is but rather instructs you to constantly evaluate the prevailing circumstances and conditions 

Factors determining safe speed include: 
- Visibility condtions
- traffic density 
- maneuverability of the vessel , especially stopping distance
- background lights at night 
- wind and current
- navigational hazards
- depth of water

Additionally, vessels with operational radar shall consider:
- Characteristics, efficiency and limitations of the radar equipment
- Range scale in use
- Effect against sea state, weather, and other sources of interference
- ability to detect small vessels and objects such as ice (may not be able to detect)
- The number, location, and movement of vessels detected
- Effective use in determining a more exact range of visibility
