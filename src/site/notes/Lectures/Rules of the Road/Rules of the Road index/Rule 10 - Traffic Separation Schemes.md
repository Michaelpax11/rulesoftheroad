a vessel shall, so far as practicable, avoid crossing traffic lanes but if obliged to do so shall cross on a heading as nearly as predictable at right angles to the general direction of traffic flow.

a vessel not crossing or joining a scheme shall not normally enter a separation zone except:
- in case of emergency to avoid immediate danger 
- to engage in fishing within a separation zone

A vessel engaged in fishing shall not impede the passage of any vessel following a traffic lane
