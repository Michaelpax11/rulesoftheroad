# Rule 9


A "narrow channel" is not defined in teh Rules. there are no limits to length, width or depth, except in relation to teh vessels involved.

In general, it may be considered narrow when, due to depth or distances between hazards, one or both vessels are severely restricted in room to maneuver. 

A channel marked by buoys may be considered a "narrow channel" to a deep draft vessel but not to a shallow draft vessel that can navigate outside the buoyed channel.

Stay as near to the starboard side of the channel as possible. 

INLAND - a PDV operating on teh Great lakes, western rivers, or waters specified by the Secretary AND proceeding DOWN BOUND with a following current shall:
- Have right-of-way over an UP BOUND vessel
- propose the manner and place of passage
- initiate the appropriate signals

The up bound vessel shall hold as necessary to permit safe passing.

Vessels of less than 20 meters in length or a sailing vessel shall not impede the passage of a vessel which can safely navigate ONLY within a narrow channel or fairway.

A vessel engaged in fishing shall not impede the passage of any other vessel navigating within a narrow channel or fairway.

SAILFISH 20 - sailing, fishing, <20m shall not impede channel

A vessel shall not cross a narrow channel or fairway if such crossing impedes the passage of a vessel which can safely navigate only within such channel or fairway.
- International - The latter vessel MAY sound the Danger signal
- Inland - The latter vessel SHALL sound the danger vessel

INT - when a vessel being overtaken in a narrow channel or fairway has to take action to permit safe passing, both vessels must exchange the signals of Rule 34

The overtaking vessel can only proceed after the overtaken vessel signals its agreement. if the overtaken vessel does not agree she MAY sound the sound the danger signal.

INLAND - comms may be exchanged via radio. 

The overtaking vessel can only proceed after the overtaken vessel signals its agreement. if the overtaken vessel does not agree she SHALL sound the sound the danger signal.

A vessel nearing a bend or an area of a narrow channel or fairway where other vessels may be obscured SHALL navigate with particular alertness and caution and SHALL sound ONE PROLONGED BLAST(4-6secs)

Any vessel SHALL avoid anchoring in a narrow channel
