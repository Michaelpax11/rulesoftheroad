# Rule 13

Any vessel overtaking any other shall keep out of the vessel being overtaken

A vessel is overtaking if 

If in doubt as to whether an overtaking situation exists, assume it does

Any subsequent alteration of bearing shall not make the overtaking vessel a crossing vessel

The overtaking vessel is NOT relieved of her responsibility to remain clear until she is finally past and clear of the vessel being overtaken

Overtaking vessel is the give-way vessel
