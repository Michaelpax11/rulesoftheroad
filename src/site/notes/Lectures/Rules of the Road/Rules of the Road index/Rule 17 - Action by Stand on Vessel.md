# Rule 17

Applies when 1 of 2 vessels is to keep out of the way - Risk of collision must exist. the stand on vessel must:

Hold course and speed

let the other vessel take appropriate action

If the give way vessel fails to act, the stand on vessel MAY take appropriate action

Stand on vessel does not have to take appropriate action until she finds herself so close that collision cannot be avoided by the action of the give way vessel alone
This point is known as "In extremis"

only at the time of in extremis, is the stand on vessel REQUIRED to take action
