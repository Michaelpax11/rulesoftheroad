# Rule 19
## International and Inland

**Applies to vessels not in sight** of one another when navigating in or near an area of restricted visibility

if you **can see the other vessel**, this **rule does not apply**

every vessel shall proceed at a safe speed (PDV engines ready for maneuver)

Necessity to keep a proper and vigilant lookout

very vessel shall have due regard to the prevailing circumstances and conditions of restricted visibility when complying with the Rules

Conduct of Vessels in any condition of visibility:

Risk of collision - if detected by radar alone shall determine if a close quarters situation is developing:
- Take avoiding action in ample time
- There is no right of way, no stand on vessel, no give way vessel, and no time for playing waiting games

##### When Altering Course, the Following Shall be Avoided:
- An alteration of course to port for a vessel **forward of the beam**, other than for the vessel being overtaken
- An alteration of course towards a vessel abeam or abaft the beam

Risk of collision - if detected 

To overtake another vessel in restricted visibility is extremely hazardous and should be avoided.

Except where it has been determined that a risk of collision does not exist, every vessel which **hears apparently forward of her beam** the fog signal of another vessel, or which **cannot avoid a close-quarters situation** with another vessel forward of her beam, shall reduce her speed to be the **minimum at which she can be kept on her course**. She shall if necessary take all her way off and in any event navigate with extreme caution until danger of collision is over.

When navigating in or near an area of restricted visibility vessels are required to sound fog signals

unless you determine there is no risk of collision, anytime you hear a fog signal apparently coming from forward of your beam you should;
- slow to bare steerageway and take all way off your vessel
- Navigate with extreme caution
