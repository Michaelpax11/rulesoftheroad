###### Elements
- Two sailing vessels
- In sight of one another
- Risk of collision exists

### International & Inland
When two sailing vessels are approaching with wind on different sides, the vessel with **wind coming over port side (on port tack)** is the **give way** vessel

When both vessels have the **wind on the same side**, the vessel which is to **windward** has to **give way**

### International & Inland 
If a vessel with the wind on the **port side** sees a vessel to windward and **cannot determine** with certainty whether the other vessel has the wind on the port or starboard side, she shall **keep**  
**out of the way** of the other

For the purposes of this Rule the windward side shall be deemed to be the side opposite that on which the mainsail is carried or, in the case of a square-rigged  
vessel, the side opposite to that on which the  
largest fore-and-aft sail is carried.
